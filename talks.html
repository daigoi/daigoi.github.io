    <li> Gluing of Fourier-Mukai partners using tensor triangulated geometry, poster presentation at <a href="https://lehmannb3.wixsite.com/james-60"> Higher Dimensional Algebraic Geometry: James 60</a>, UCSD, January 2024</li>

        <summary>Abstract</summary>
        We initiate studies of the relationship between birational geometry of smooth varieties and tensor structures of their derived categories. A crucial insight from tensor triangulated geometry is that we can view a variety as a specific tensor structure on its derived category and an upshot is that closer observations on such tensor structures allow us to glue its Fourier-Mukai partners to construct a smooth scheme locally of finite type, which we call the Fourier-Mukai locus. The geometry of the locus reflects geometric properties of the Fourier-Mukai partners in various contexts, such as abelian, toric, and Fano varieties, as well as birational operations among them such as flops. We further investigate relations with the DK hypothesis and methods to purely categorically characterize the locus.

    <li> Symmetries on derived categories and reconstruction of elliptic curves, <a href="https://eisenbud.github.io/deSeminar/"> Eisenbud's Seminar on Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry</a>, UC Berkeley, Octorber 2023 </li>

        <summary>Abstract</summary>
        We know the structure of the derived category of coherent sheaves on an elliptic curve very well and moreover it has been known that an elliptic curve can be reconstructed from categorical structures of its derived category. In this talk, we will discuss a version of reconstruction of elliptic curves that was announced this year, using symmetry of derived categories coming from their autoequivalences. Moreover, if time permits, we will see possible generalization and obstructions to higher dimensional cases, which were discussed in my recent paper in relation with monoidal structures on derived categories.

    I am a third-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/" >UC Berkeley</a> working with <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~nadler/">David Nadler</a>. <br> <br>
    I received my A.B. in mathematics from <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>, where my senior thesis advisor was
    <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~kollar/">János Kollár</a>. <br> <br>
    My research interests lie in algebraic geometry, homological algebra and symplectic geometry. 
    I am particularly interested in:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Geometric information contained in derived categories of coherent sheaves (e.g. Orlov's conjecture on the Rouqier dimension); 
        <li>
            Birational geometry (the minimal model program, DK hypothesis);
        <li>
            Tensor triangular geometry;
        <li>
            The homological mirror symmetry and its application to studies of derived categories of coherent sheaves;
        <li> 
            (Noncommutative) derived algebraic geometry.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Daigo Ito </h1>
    <p>I am a first-year graduate student in the mathematics department at UC Berkeley. My research interest lies
        broadly in algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and symplectic geometry. I am particularly interested in
        the homological mirror symmetry, the minimal model program, singularity theory, the derived category of coherent
        sheaves, moduli problems of algebraic varieties, Fukaya categories, and Gromov-Witten theory. </p>
